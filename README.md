# Playing with Clojure

Just mucking around with Clojure.

Right now, it's is a k-means implementation, along with a demo you can play with
to step through each iteration of k-means. The GUI is built on top of quil.

![K-means demo](https://raw.github.com/eshira/clojure-play/master/k-means-clojure.gif "K-means Demo")

## Running the Demo

    lein repl
    (in-ns 'cljplay.demo)
